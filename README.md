## About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a passionate Android developer with over two years of professional experience at Saaland and around three years of diving deep into Kotlin and Android development.

But my curiosity doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”Iâ€™m on a mission to master web application security and break into the world of ethical hacking. Lately, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my skills in Go and JavaScript to better understand the security landscape and build (or break!) more resilient systems.

I thrive on challenges, love solving complex problems, and always push myself to explore new technologies. Whether it's crafting a seamless mobile experience or uncovering vulnerabilities in a web app, I'm all about pushing boundaries.

Break. Learn. Build. Repeat. ðŸ”¥
